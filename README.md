authentigate
============

It is high time that everyone encrypt their e-mail communication, that every app shares user and group 
information with others and foremost: lets get rid of paswords that a dictionary atack can crack.

How does authentigate suggest to solve these problems?

* offer a centralised and shareable LDAP like database for linking tenants and their users and groups to applications
* provide a simple plattform for managing group membership for users
* allow trust (with limits) relationships between authentigate servers
* manage a private and public key for every user and group
* allow users who have lost access to their account to have it unlocked by a trusted third party (e.g a friend or familly member)
* allow linking accounts from any provider like google, twitter, facebook, OpenID, persona and many more
* leverage such services as Gravatar
